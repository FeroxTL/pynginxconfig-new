pynginxconfig
=============

This repo is most likely broken now because this is unstable version of pynginxconfig.

You can try using master branch to see the future of pynginxconfig. Tests are working now, you can see it by using
`python test.py`
Also sinse branch **parser** is merged to master you can try the new parser by using `python parser.py`

Good luck!
